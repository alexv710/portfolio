A delightful and healthy dessert that combines the tropical flavors of mango with the richness of coconut milk and the texture of chia seeds. It's a perfect treat to satisfy your sweet cravings in a nutritious way.

## Ingredients

- **Mangoes:** 2 large, ripe (one for puree and one for topping)
- **Chia seeds:** 60 grams
- **Coconut milk:** 400 ml
- **Honey or maple syrup:** 30 ml (about 2 tablespoons, or adjust to taste)
- **Vanilla extract:** 5 ml (1 teaspoon)
- **Lime:** juice of 1 lime
- **Mint leaves:** for garnish (optional)

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare Mango Puree
- Peel and chop one mango. Blend it in a blender or food processor until smooth. Set aside.

### 2. Mix Chia Pudding
- In a bowl, combine chia seeds, coconut milk, honey (or maple syrup), vanilla extract, and half of the lime juice. Whisk until well combined.
- Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes, then stir again to break up any clumps of chia seeds. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight, until the chia seeds have absorbed the liquid and the mixture has a pudding-like consistency.

### 3. Layer the Dessert
- Spoon a layer of mango puree into the bottom of serving glasses or bowls.
- Gently pour the chia pudding over the mango layer.
- Chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve.

### 4. Serve
- Before serving, dice the second mango and toss it with the remaining lime juice.
- Top each serving with fresh mango chunks.
- Garnish with mint leaves if desired.

## Tips

- For a smoother texture, you can blend the chia pudding mixture after it has set.
- Adjust the sweetness of the dessert according to the ripeness of the mangoes and your personal preference.
- This dessert can be made in advance and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
