This stir-fried dish is a perfect blend of tender beef and fresh broccoli in a rich, savory sauce.

## Ingredients

- **Beef slices:** (sirloin or flank steak works well)
- **Broccoli florets**
- **Garlic:** Minced
- **Oyster sauce**
- **Soy sauce**
- **Sugar**
- **Cornstarch:** (for marinating beef and thickening sauce)
- **Sesame oil**

## Preparation

1. **Marinate the Beef**: In a bowl, mix soy sauce, cornstarch, and a bit of sesame oil. Add the beef slices to the marinade and let sit for at least 30 minutes.
2. **Cook the Beef**: In a wok or large frying pan, heat some oil over medium-high heat. Add the marinated beef and stir-fry until just cooked. Remove the beef from the pan and set aside.
3. **Stir-Fry Broccoli and Garlic**: In the same pan, add a bit more oil if needed. Stir-fry the garlic until fragrant, then add the broccoli florets. Cook until the broccoli is tender-crisp.
4. **Combine and Finish**: Return the beef to the pan with the broccoli. Add oyster sauce and sugar. If needed, make a slurry with cornstarch and water and add to the pan to thicken the sauce. Stir everything together and cook for a few more minutes.
5. **Serve**: Serve the beef and broccoli hot, garnished with a sprinkle of sesame seeds if desired.
