# Hong Kong Style Bok Choy

A simple, stir-fried bok choy dish with garlic can be a refreshing side that complements the richness of Char Siu.

## Ingredients

- **Baby bok choy:** 4-5 pieces, washed and cut in half
- **Garlic:** 2 cloves, minced
- **Soy sauce:** 1 tablespoon
- **Oyster sauce:** 1 tablespoon
- **Sesame oil:** A drizzle

## Instructions

1. **Stir-fry Garlic**: Heat some oil in a wok or frying pan. Add the minced garlic and quickly stir-fry until fragrant.
2. **Cook Bok Choy**: Add the bok choy to the pan. Stir-fry until the leaves begin to wilt and the stems are tender-crisp.
3. **Season**: Add soy sauce and oyster sauce. Drizzle with a bit of sesame oil. Toss everything together to coat the bok choy evenly with the seasonings.
4. **Serve**: Serve the bok choy hot as a side dish.
